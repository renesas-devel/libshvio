 * \section autoconf Using GNU autoconf
 *
 * If you are using GNU autoconf, you do not need to call pkg-config
 * directly. Use the following macro to determine if libshvio is
 * available:
 *
 <pre>
 PKG_CHECK_MODULES(SHVIO, shvio >= 0.5.0,
                   HAVE_SHVIO="yes", HAVE_SHVIO="no")
 if test "x$HAVE_SHVIO" = "xyes" ; then
   AC_SUBST(SHVIO_CFLAGS)
   AC_SUBST(SHVIO_LIBS)
 fi
 </pre>
 *
 * If libshvio is found, HAVE_SHVIO will be set to "yes", and
 * the autoconf variables SHVIO_CFLAGS and SHVIO_LIBS will
 * be set appropriately.
 *
 * \section pkg-config Determining compiler options with pkg-config
 *
 * If you are not using GNU autoconf in your project, you can use the
 * pkg-config tool directly to determine the correct compiler options.
 *
 <pre>
 SHVIO_CFLAGS=`pkg-config --cflags shvio`

 SHVIO_LIBS=`pkg-config --libs shvio`
 </pre>
